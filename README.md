# Rental Demand Forecast and Automation

This repo acts as a code dump of my first data sciece project - A bunch of tasks undertaken over Summer'17 that demonstrate the load-clean-train-test-deploy cycle for a corporate firm. The objectives were (1) Build one of the earliest rental demand prediction models and (2) automate the rental demand and model performance reporting processes.
